# Installation

It's very simple to start debugging with LaraDumps:

- First, download and install the [LaraDumps Desktop App](laravel/get-started/installation?id=desktop-app).
- Then, install the [LaraDumps Laravel Package](laravel/get-started/installation?id=laravel-package) in your current Laravel project.

Read the instructions below:

## Desktop App

LaraDumps Desktop App is available for Windows, Linux and MacOS.

Proceed to the installation instructions according to your operating system:

<!--LaraDumpsVersion-->
<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Windows**

Click to [`Download LaraDumps v1.2.3`](https://github.com/laradumps/app/releases/download/v1.2.3/LaraDumps-Setup-1.2.3.exe) installer for Windows.

Once downloaded, open it and proceed with the installer.

#### **Linux**

Click to [`Download LaraDumps v1.2.3`](https://github.com/laradumps/app/releases/download/v1.2.3/LaraDumps-1.2.3.AppImage) application image for Linux.

Once downloaded, assign *execution permission* to the file:

Click on `Properties`, navigate to `Permissions` and click `Allow to execute file as program`. Now, open the AppImage file to proceed with the installation.

Alternatively, use the Terminal and run the command below:

```shell

```

*(These steps might slightly change depending on your Linux distribution).*

Once downloaded, open the file and drag & drop the LaraDumps app into your `Applications` folder.

#### Authorizing the app

The first time you open LaraDumps, you will receive an alert saying with `LaraDumps cannot be opened`.

Don't worry! The alert is because the app code is not signed with Apple. LaraDumps is not a malicious software and all code is open-source.

To `authorize LaraDumps to run`, follow these steps:

1â€¤ Click on the ï£¿ (Apple logo) on the top menu.

2â€¤ Go to `System Preferences`.

3â€¤ Open the `Security & Privacy` tab.

4â€¤ Click on the ðŸ”’ (lock pad) and enter your password to authenticate.

5â€¤ Click `Open Anyway` for LaraDumps.

6â€¤ Once again, click `Open` when you are prompted about "This is an Internet Application".

Now, LaraDumps should run just fine!
